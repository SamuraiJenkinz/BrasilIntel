"""
EquityTicker ORM model for BrasilIntel.

Multi-row mapping table that associates company entity names (as extracted by
the AI classifier) with their exchange ticker symbols for equity price enrichment.

Created in Phase 11 — Equity Price Enrichment.

Each row maps one entity_name → (ticker, exchange) pair. The EquityPriceClient
reads enabled rows at enrichment time to look up current price data via the MMC
Core API equity endpoint.

The entity_name field must match exactly what the AI classifier produces (e.g.
"Marsh McLennan", "AIG", "Swiss Re") — this is the join key used in Plan 02
pipeline integration.

    """
    ORM model for entity-to-ticker mappings.

    Each row maps a company entity name (as extracted by AI classification) to
    its exchange ticker symbol. The pipeline enrichment step (Phase 11-02) uses
    these mappings to automatically fetch equity price data for relevant entities
    mentioned in classified articles.

    Admin-managed via /admin/equity CRUD interface.

    Fields:
        entity_name     - Company name as extracted by AI classifier (unique key)
        ticker          - Exchange ticker symbol (e.g. "MMC", "AIG")
        exchange        - Exchange code (e.g. "BVMF", "NYSE", "NASDAQ")
        enabled         - Disable mapping without deleting the row
        updated_at      - Auto-updated timestamp on every save
